## Introduction
The goal of this project was to realize applications (code and/or nocode) answering a precise need of a customer, a group or an association. We joined a group of salesmen who founded the group "Hello Caen" and we realized an application allowing to answer their expectations. The application is able to :
- display the list of all businesses (registered on the platform and nearby)
- notification system in case of good deals for a favorite business
- rate and comment on businesses

The code is however incomplete due to a lack of time (only the administration part has not been completely realized).
